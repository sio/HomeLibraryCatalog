# HomeLibraryCatalog
Web application for cataloging home books collection


# Unfinished project!
This project is in the early stages of development, most of the time it doesn't
even start and if it starts it might do something unexpected and irreversible

Consider yourself warned


# Requirements
* **python3** with following packages (available via `pip install`)
    * **bottle** - micro web framework with built-in simple web server
    * **pillow** - image manipulation library
    * **lxml** with **cssselect** - HTML scraping library


# Installation and usage
This application doesn't require installation, just unzip it and start

To start it with default settings launch `HomeLibraryCatalog.py`

Configuration file is named `hlc.config` and is located in the same directory
as the `HomeLibraryCatalog.py` by default

# Localization status
As of now all user interaction happens in Russian

Localization is not planned in the foreseable future due to the lack of human
resources

All locale-dependent text is contained in template files (*.tpl).
Application supports changing template directory via configuration file, so all
locale-specific text can be translated and placed into another directory.
Proper localizations tools and techniques (gettext et al) are not yet supported
