# Localization status
As of now all user interaction happens in Russian

Localization is not planned in the foreseable future due to the lack of human
resources

All locale-dependent text is contained in template files (*.tpl).
Application supports changing template directory via configuration file, so all
locale-specific text can be translated and placed into another directory.
Proper localizations tools and techniques (gettext et al) are not yet supported
